# Third person RPG sandbox

This is a playground to play with (and learn) different hacks about third person RPG development with Godot. Created with Godot v.3.2.3 and tested on Windows 10 and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). 

Currently, the project has following functionality:

- Third person controller with a placeholder and idle/walk animation
- Two types of enemies (knight and archer)
